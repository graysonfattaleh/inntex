                For the last two decades, the <a href="https://religion.byu.edu/departments#:~:text=As%20an%20integral%20part%20of,restored%20gospel%20of%20Jesus%20Christ."> Department of Ancient Scripture </a> has invested its resources on an excavation site southwest of Cairo, Egypt.
                Along with an uncovered pyramid and Greco-Roman Township, the dig site contained a massive necropolis where thousands of the deceased have been excavated. There is so much that we have learned from theses excavations and are still learning as we do more analysis.
